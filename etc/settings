# Settings for Duplicacy scripts

# NOTE: If this file exists during an upgrade, it will be left alone
# and the new version will be placed in settings-upgrade.


# If this is set, do an automatic update of the scripts by pulling
# the sources from GitHub and doing a 'make update'.
# CONFIG_AUTO_UPDATE=yes


# If defined, limit bandwidth use to this value in megabits per
# second.  (This contrasts with Duplicacy's parameter, which is
# expressed in kilobytes per second.)
# CONFIG_BANDWIDTH=20


# If this is not set, skip doing storage maintenance.  Setting this is
# useful when multiple machines share the same storage and saves on
# download traffic if the storage is a paid service.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: Maintenance should be disabled during long-running
# initial backups.  This will prevent having unrefernced chunks from
# the incomplete backup fossilized, resulting in additional stored
# data and lower deduplication rates.

# CONFIG_NO_MAINT=yes


# If CONFIG_NO_MAINT is not set, remove files from the cache that have
# not been accesses in more than this number of days.
CONFIG_CACHE_LIFE=90


# Number of days to keep logs
CONFIG_LOG_LIFE=90

# Un-comment to make backup and prune operations inert
# DRY_RUN=yes
