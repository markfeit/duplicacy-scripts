# Prune Policy for Duplicacy
#

# This file will be sorted into the proper order so pruning of older
# snapshots happens first.


# General-use policy that keeps overall storage use down.

                # Prior to seven days, keep all snapshots.
1	7	# One per day for snapshots older than 7 days
7	30	# One per week for snapshots older than a month
30	180	# One per 30 days for snapshots older than 180 days
0	360	# None older than 360 days



# This policy is better for services like Wasabi that charge for 90
# days of storage even if an object has a shorter life than that.

#               # Prior to 89 days, keep all snapshots.
# 30	89	# One per 30 days for snapshots older than the limit
# 0	360	# None older than 360 days
